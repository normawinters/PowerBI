DAX vs Power Query

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
-------------------------------
•	Purpose: Calculations & analytics on loaded data
•	Use for: 
	Calculated columns & measures
	Aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)
	Time intelligence (YTD, running totals)
	Dynamic calculations with filters/slicers
•	When: After data is in the model
•	Example: Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

Power Query (M Language)
-----------------------------
•	Purpose: Data transformation & preparation
•	Use for: 
	Cleaning & shaping data during import
	Merging/joining tables
	Removing duplicates, filtering rows
	Changing data types, splitting columns
•	When: Before data enters the model
•	Example: Remove blanks, unpivot columns
Key Difference
•	Power Query: Transforms data once during refresh
•	DAX: Calculates every time visuals update

Best Practice
----------------------------------
Transform in Power Query → Calculate in DAX
