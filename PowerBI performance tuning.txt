Benchmark before and after changes
Document what changed: measures, aggregrtions, unused columns, etc.  

Tools available: 
   DAX Performance Analysis
   DAX Studio (essential tool)

**Performance Analyzer (built into Power BI Desktop)

View → Performance Analyzer → Start Recording
Interact with visuals to see which ones are slow
Breaks down time by DAX query, visual display, and other operations
Export results to analyze DAX queries in DAX Studio

**Check measure calculation times

Look for measures taking > 1 second in Performance Analyzer
Identify if the issue is in formula engine (complex calculations) or storage engine (data retrieval)

Watch for high cardinality relationships causing performance issues

Monitor storage engine vs formula engine

Storage engine queries should be fast (optimized by VertiPaq)

Formula engine operations are row-by-row and slower
Use SUMX, FILTER sparingly—these often force formula engine processing

Check for materialization

Look in query plans for materialization steps (temporary tables in memory)
These indicate expensive operations that could potentially be optimized

Power Query Performance Checks
**********************************

Tools Available: 

Query Diagnostics (built into Power Query)

Tools → Query Diagnostics → Start Diagnostics
Refresh your queries
Stop Diagnostics and review the diagnostic results
Shows duration for each step and data source queries

Check query folding

Right-click a step → View Native Query
If grayed out, folding has broken—steps after that run in Power BI's engine
Keep folding active as long as possible for database sources 

What is query folding?

Query folding is Power Query's ability to translate M transformations into native SQL that executes on your database server rather than pulling all data into Power BI's memory. When folding works, you're essentially letting Power Query write optimized SQL for you—filtering, joining, and aggregating at the source. It breaks when you use M functions the database can't understand (like custom text operations), at which point Power BI loads data into memory to finish the transformations(slows performance).

Monitor refresh times

Check the refresh history in Power BI Service
Use Power BI Desktop's refresh preview to time local refreshes
Identify which queries are taking the longest

Review step-by-step duration

Add a custom step that records time: = Duration.From(DateTime.LocalNow() - #datetime(2024,1,1,0,0,0))
Compare before and after each transformation to find slow steps

Check data source queries

In Query Diagnostics, look at "Data Source Query" duration
Long data source queries might indicate missing indexes or inefficient source queries
Consider pushing more logic to the source (if folding works)

Monitor memory usage

Task Manager during refresh to see memory spikes
Large memory usage indicates tables loaded entirely into memory
Often caused by broken query folding or loading too many columns

Evaluate parallelism

Power Query can run multiple queries in parallel
Check if queries have dependencies that prevent parallel execution
Reorganize to allow more parallel processing

Model-Level Performance Checks
Check model size

Large .pbix files load slowly and consume more memory
Use VertiPaq Analyzer in DAX Studio to see table and column sizes
Remove unnecessary columns and tables

Analyze relationships

Many-to-many relationships are slower than one-to-many
Bidirectional filters impact performance
Check relationship cardinality is set correctly

Review cardinality and data distribution

High cardinality columns (many unique values) use more memory
Use VertiPaq Analyzer to identify problematic columns
Consider if you need all unique values or can group them

Check aggregations

For large datasets, consider using aggregation tables
Power BI can automatically route queries to aggregated data

Monitor incremental refresh

For large tables, incremental refresh reduces refresh times
Only refreshes recent data instead of entire table


-----------------------------------
General Best Practices for Testing
-----------------------------------

Test with realistic data volumes

Performance issues often only appear with production-sized data
Test with full dataset before deploying

Use Query Plans in DAX Studio

Physical and logical query plans show exactly how queries execute
Identify scans, seeks, and expensive operations

Benchmark before and after changes

Record baseline performance metrics
Make one change at a time and measure impact
Keep a log of what improved/worsened performance

Monitor in production

Power BI Service has usage metrics and performance data
Premium capacities have additional monitoring through capacity metrics app
Set up alerts for slow-running reports
